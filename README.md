# Team Stats
We want to create and extract information about our favorite football team. We will create data using the JavaScript data structures: arrays, objects, etc.

Once created, we can manipulate these data structures as well as gain insights from them. For example, we might want to get the total number of games the team has played, or the average score of all of their games.
